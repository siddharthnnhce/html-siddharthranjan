<h1>About Me</h1>
<p></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Siddharth Ranjan,<br/> and I am currently pursuing a B.E. degree in Computer Engineering at NHCE College in Bangalore. Although I'm dedicated to my studies in this vibrant city, my heart belongs to the serene town of Muzaffarpur, Bihar, where I grew up. This unique blend of urban and rural experiences has shaped my worldview and given me a diverse perspective. I'm deeply passionate about computer engineering, always eager to learn and explore new avenues of knowledge. Beyond academics, I enjoy engaging in activities that foster personal growth and connect me with the world around me. This combination of cultural richness and academic ambition defines who I am, and I'm excited to see where this educational journey in computer engineering takes me.</p>
